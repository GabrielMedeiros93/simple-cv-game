# cvPong!

This is a simple "Pong-style" game using OpenCV. In this case, instead of moving the paddles with the mouse or keyboard, the game uses a color tracking system to detect a yellow object, as a tennis ball, which acts as a joystick for the game.

The current version is for two players. 

Any other objects can be used as joysticks if the HSV filtering values are modified.
